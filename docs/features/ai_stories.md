## Why These Features Matter

### For Gen Z & Millennials
- **Information Overload**: Managing multiple group chats, DMs, and platforms is overwhelming
- **Context Switching**: Moving between friend groups, school, and interests is mentally taxing
- **Memory Management**: Important conversations get lost in the noise
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Different friend groups use different platforms
- **Expression Needs**: Need for rich, contextual ways to share thoughts and feelings

### For Creators & Communities
- **Inspiration Tracking**: Ideas come from everywhere and need to be connected
- **Community Management**: Keeping track of conversations across platforms
- **Content Organization**: Linking references and inspirations naturally
- **Audience Engagement**: Managing interactions across multiple channels

### For Everyone
- **Relationship Management**: Keeping track of conversations and contexts with different people
- **Knowledge Organization**: Naturally building personal knowledge bases
- **Platform Flexibility**: Freedom to use preferred platforms without losing context
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less mental energy spent on organizing digital life
