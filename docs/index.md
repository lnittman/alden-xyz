## Key Concepts

### Ambient Intelligence
Our core philosophy is that AI should be felt rather than seen. Intelligence is woven into the fabric of conversations, surfacing relevant context and connections naturally.

### Context System
The context engine understands:
- Message-level context (content, references, emotion)
- Thread-level context (topics, relationships, timeline)
- User-level context (preferences, history, relationships)
- Workspace context (projects, teams, knowledge)

### Platform Integration
Seamless integration across:
- Native chat experience
- External platforms (Slack, Discord, etc)
- Development tools
- Knowledge bases

### Implementation Approach
1. **Foundation** (Current)
   - Core context detection
   - Basic embedding pipeline
   - Initial UI components
   - Message-level features

2. **Intelligence** (Next)
   - Enhanced context detection
   - Knowledge graph integration
   - Smart suggestions
   - Thread merging

3. **Ambient Features** (Future)
   - Real-time enhancements
   - Predictive suggestions
   - Advanced visualization
   - Context sharing

4. **Platform Scale** (Future)
   - Cross-platform context
   - Universal knowledge graph
   - Community features
   - Enterprise capabilities
