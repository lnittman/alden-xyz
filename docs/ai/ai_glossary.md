# AI System Glossary

## Core Systems

### Reference System
The internal linking and relationship engine.

Components:
- Embedding Generation: Vertex AI multimodal embeddings
- Vector Search: Similarity matching in Supabase
- Link Management: Reference tracking and updates
- Cache System: Embedding and relationship caching

Use Cases:
- Direct mentions (@user)
- Content references (#message)
- File linking
- Space connections
- Topic tracking

### Suggestion System
The smart discovery and ambient intelligence engine.

Components:
- Real-time Analysis: Content and context understanding
- Multi-source Search: Internal and external discovery
- Relevance Ranking: Smart prioritization
- Timing Engine: Contextual delivery

Sources:
- Internal content (vector search)
- Web content (API integrations)
- Environmental data (time, location)
- Cultural context (trending, zeitgeist)
- User patterns (historical analysis)

### Context Engine
The brain coordinating references and suggestions.

Components:
- State Management: Active context tracking
- Pattern Recognition: Usage and interaction patterns
- Emotional Intelligence: Mood and tone analysis
- Environmental Awareness: Situational understanding
- Privacy Guardian: Context boundary management

Functions:
- Reference Coordination: Managing active links
- Suggestion Orchestration: Timing and relevance
- Ambient Intelligence: Environmental adaptation
- Experience Flow: Conversation guidance
- Privacy Control: Context isolation
