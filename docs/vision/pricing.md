## frequently asked questions

### why do all plans require payment?
we use advanced AI models that are costly to run. rather than compromise the experience with a limited free tier, we offer a fair trial and accessible pricing for sustained quality.

you'll still be able to send messages and use basic features. AI features will resume the next day, or you can upgrade your plan for immediate access to more operations.

messages are stored securely and encrypted. solo tier keeps 30 days of history, while plus and space get unlimited history. you can export your data anytime.

### can i switch between plans?
