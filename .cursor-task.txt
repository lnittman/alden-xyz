# Migrate Authentication from Supabase to Clerk

You are working on the Alden messaging platform in a turborepo monorepo. 

## Task: Create the auth package and setup Clerk authentication

1. Create packages/auth directory with proper structure
2. Install Clerk dependencies: @clerk/nextjs @clerk/clerk-sdk-node @clerk/types
3. Create auth package files:
   - package.json with Clerk dependencies
   - src/index.ts exporting Clerk utilities
   - src/clerk-provider.tsx with ClerkProvider wrapper
   - src/hooks.ts with useAuth and useUser hooks
   - src/helpers.ts with getAuthUser and requireAuth functions

4. Update apps/app/src/middleware.ts to use Clerk middleware
5. Create auth pages in apps/app/src/app/(auth)/
   - sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
   - sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx

6. Update apps/app/src/app/layout.tsx to wrap with ClerkProvider

IMPORTANT: 
- Use bun as package manager
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- The marketing page already uses Clerk (see apps/app/src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx)
- Use workspace:* for internal dependencies

Start by creating the packages/auth structure.
