# Database Migration Task - Implement Drizzle ORM

## Context
You're working on the Alden messaging platform. The database package structure already exists at packages/database, but needs to be properly implemented with Drizzle ORM.

## Task: Create the Drizzle ORM database schema

1. **Install Drizzle dependencies in packages/database:**
   - drizzle-orm
   - postgres
   - drizzle-kit (dev dependency)
   - @types/pg (dev dependency)

2. **Create the schema files in packages/database/src/schema:**
   - users.ts - User tables (synced with Clerk)
   - chats.ts - Chat and chat members tables
   - messages.ts - Messages, attachments, reactions, reads
   - references.ts - Reference and reference items tables
   - relations.ts - All table relations
   - index.ts - Export all schemas

3. **Create the database client in packages/database/src/client.ts:**
   - Set up Drizzle with PostgreSQL
   - Export db instance

4. **Create drizzle.config.ts in packages/database:**
   - Configure for PostgreSQL
   - Point to schema files
   - Set up migrations directory

5. **Update packages/database/src/index.ts:**
   - Export all schemas, client, and types

## Key Requirements:
- Use bun as package manager
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Tables should support chat/messaging functionality
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Follow existing project patterns

Start by installing the required dependencies.
